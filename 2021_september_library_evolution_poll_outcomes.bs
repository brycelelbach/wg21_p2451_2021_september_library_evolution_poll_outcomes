# Introduction # {#introduction}

In September 2021, the C++ Library Evolution group conducted a series of
  electronic decision polls [[P2436R0]].
This paper provides the results of those polls and summarizes the results.

In total, 23 people participated in the polls.
Some participants opted to not vote on some polls.
Thank you to everyone who participated, and to the proposal authors for all
  their hard work!
